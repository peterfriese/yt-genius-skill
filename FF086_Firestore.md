### Description
Building a recipe app? Stop worrying about backend infrastructure and focus on the code. In this video,  @peterfriese from the Firebase team shows you how to build a complete "cookbook" feature using Cloud Firestore and Swift.

You'll learn how to map your Swift structs directly to Firestore documents using Codable, making data handling a breeze. We’ll cover everything from saving your first recipe to listening for real-time updates, so your users always see the latest data across all their devices. Plus, we'll look at how to secure your data with Firestore Security Rules.

In this video, you'll learn:
* How to model your data with Swift structs, Identifiable, and Codable.
* Performing CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete.
* The difference between one-time fetches and real-time Snapshot Listeners.
* How to handle optional fields and partial updates.
* Essential tips for writing Firestore Security Rules.
