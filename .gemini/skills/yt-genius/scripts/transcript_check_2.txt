[00:00] Hey, how's it going? I'm Noey.
[00:02] >> And I'm Rodie.
[00:03] >> And we're here for our second Untitled
[00:05] podcast. We're thinking tech walks or
[00:08] something of that nature because we just
[00:09] happen to be walking outside when we
[00:11] record these. Uh, and today we wanted to
[00:13] talk about the Gemini CLI and the
[00:16] anti-gravity.
[00:17] >> Yeah, we are very excited about this
[00:19] episode. I can't wait to dive into the
[00:22] different ways we're using AI in our
[00:24] workflows and also Gemini 3.
[00:26] >> Yeah. So, actually, did you know in the
[00:28] Gemini CLI you can do like slash
[00:31] settings and you can go through and set
[00:33] a whole bunch of different configuration
[00:34] options?
[00:35] >> Oh, yeah, totally.
[00:36] >> So, one of the configurations options is
[00:38] to actually use the newer models. I
[00:40] don't know if that's just pinned to
[00:41] Gemini 3. I guess we'll find out when
[00:43] [clears throat] Gemini 4 or Gemini 5 or
[00:45] whatever comes out, right?
[00:46] >> Uh, but that's one way that you can
[00:48] quickly upgrade to a newer model to try
[00:51] it out in your workflow
[00:52] >> uh when it's whenever they introduce it,
[00:54] right?
[00:55] >> Absolutely. Yeah. And uh we can
[00:56] definitely leave links down in the
[00:58] comments on how to do that.
[00:59] >> Yeah. So Gemini CLI came out. I've been
[01:02] using it for the last few months and
[01:04] then anti-gravity came out like last
[01:06] month.
[01:07] >> Yeah.
[01:07] >> And I have not fully migrated to it yet.
[01:09] >> Oh, interesting. Yeah.
[01:10] >> You have?
[01:11] >> Yeah. I feel like I've I've completely
[01:13] done the opposite. I started with Gemini
[01:16] CLI uh the second it launched was really
[01:19] starting to use it heavily even inside
[01:22] of Firebase Studio when we included it.
[01:24] Um, I felt like Gemini CLI was way more
[01:28] of the agent dev loop that I was kind of
[01:30] used to where I could have access to
[01:32] tools. I was not afraid to write bash
[01:36] scripts or uh be able to read and write
[01:38] files. I felt like I had control over I
[01:41] want you to work in this directory.
[01:43] You know, it's funny because Gemini CLI,
[01:44] it will do one of those things where
[01:46] >> I'm [clears throat] looking for a very
[01:47] specific file
[01:49] >> and I know that there's a bash command
[01:52] like set or or grab or whatever,
[01:55] >> but I know it exists. I don't know the
[01:59] command. So, Gemini CLI is really good
[02:02] at like just being like, "Oh, I know
[02:04] what you want to do." And then sometimes
[02:05] it'll do like there's a said command to
[02:07] find and replace as well.
[02:08] >> Oh, yeah. Yeah. So I I used that for
[02:10] like some documentation pages where we
[02:12] change like I you know all of our docs
[02:15] had one name and then we had to change
[02:16] it to another name. Oh yes. Yeah. So
[02:18] that was a very cool way to use the
[02:20] Gemini CLI. And the thing I like about
[02:22] the Gemini CLI
[02:24] >> is it kind of works how my brain works
[02:25] where I just go and I work linearly
[02:28] through a task. Yeah. Right.
[02:30] >> And even there's a task feature now too.
[02:32] >> Is there?
[02:33] >> Yes.
[02:34] >> Built into Gemini CLI where basically
[02:36] it'll create like a task file. It'll
[02:38] show the list of things that it's
[02:39] working on and take it off.
[02:41] >> Yeah. So, the the task mode I I I
[02:43] haven't used that yet, but the way that
[02:44] I used tasks was uh I would have it
[02:47] write a plan first to say, "Hey, replace
[02:51] all my dependencies or upgrade this
[02:53] project or do something like that
[02:55] >> and then go through and give me a plan
[02:57] for how you would do it."
[02:59] >> Oh.
[02:59] >> And then I and then I would feed it back
[03:01] and be like, "That plan sounds good. I
[03:03] didn't read it, but it sounds good. Go
[03:04] ahead and do that." Right. Y because it
[03:06] usually kind of like prompts the model
[03:08] on the the expected steps in the
[03:10] workflow because by default it would
[03:12] kind of just like do the task and exit,
[03:15] >> you know,
[03:16] >> and and I found that I could get like
[03:17] more complicated prompts that way,
[03:19] right?
[03:20] >> Uh and then occasionally when I use the
[03:22] CLI, I'll clear and start over and do
[03:25] some other things just to get like the
[03:27] things I'm looking for and I
[03:28] continuously get commit, you know, after
[03:30] every test run, right? Yeah. Which it I
[03:33] think it even has checkpoints now, too.
[03:34] Does it? Oh, okay. That's great. So, uh
[03:38] you are a big fan of anti-gravity.
[03:40] >> Yes. Yeah.
[03:41] >> And I know that it works differently,
[03:44] >> right, with like the async loop and like
[03:47] you just kind of be like go do this
[03:48] thing. I'm going to go drink some
[03:50] coffee, right?
[03:51] >> Yeah. So, I feel like with anti-gravity,
[03:54] um one of the big differences was uh
[03:56] Gemini CLI was kind of focused on I'm
[03:58] solving this like one-off workflow.
[04:00] Yeah, I'm doing this thing to fix
[04:04] whatever. But with anti-gravity, I can
[04:06] think at a project level. I'm like, I
[04:09] want to migrate the state management or
[04:12] I want to switch from this database to a
[04:15] completely different provider or my
[04:17] approach and like the the complex
[04:20] refactoring is super awesome because it
[04:22] comes up with an implementation plan. It
[04:24] comes up with verification steps. It
[04:27] comes up with automated testing, manual
[04:29] testing. It literally at the end of the
[04:32] loop it'll be okay now human you know go
[04:35] check this thing that you need to run
[04:37] through to verify that it's working and
[04:38] it's that that I just found like to be
[04:40] really really awesome.
[04:42] >> Yeah it sounds like it. So one other
[04:45] question I had for you is you say that
[04:46] you give it this task and then you're
[04:48] able to like walk away. Do you do that
[04:49] through the agent manager or do you do
[04:51] it through like another type of thing?
[04:52] >> So one of the cool UX pieces of it is it
[04:55] actually doesn't matter. You can do it
[04:57] from either side. So if you are in the
[05:00] normal editor and you have a chat and
[05:02] you ask it to kick off a task, you can
[05:05] hit commande or on Windows there's an
[05:07] equivalent
[05:08] >> and it will be both running in the agent
[05:11] manager and also inside of the editor.
[05:15] So I can close out the editor if I want
[05:17] to and come back to it. Yeah,
[05:19] >> you're killing me. Because what I've
[05:20] been doing is sometimes I I'll kick off
[05:22] a task in the chat like in the editor
[05:24] [laughter] and I'll be like, I don't
[05:26] want this to finish and I'll close the
[05:27] editor,
[05:28] >> but then I'll still get a popup and I'm
[05:30] like, what happened?
[05:31] >> Yeah, because it's totally running in
[05:32] the background. [laughter]
[05:34] >> Oh man, I feel I feel like a fool.
[05:37] >> So, uh uh pro tip, make sure [laughter]
[05:41] you not do that. Hit stop first.
[05:43] >> Yeah.
[05:44] >> Yeah. And then there was another
[05:45] interesting thing and I wanted to
[05:48] understand how you did this because I
[05:50] don't fully understand how this works.
[05:52] >> Okay.
[05:52] >> So how do you approach multiple tasks in
[05:55] the same project? Because what I like to
[05:57] do which I know is wrong
[05:59] >> 100% know it's wrong is I will start a
[06:02] task in the agent manager.
[06:03] >> Okay.
[06:04] >> Then switch to a different branch
[06:06] >> in my terminal.
[06:08] >> Yep.
[06:08] >> I I know the commands to do that. I
[06:10] don't have to ask Gemini CLI. I know how
[06:11] to do that. Uh, and then I go back to
[06:14] the agent manager and ask it to do a new
[06:16] task in the same project
[06:18] >> and it seems to
[06:20] >> have a hard time. Yeah.
[06:21] >> Yeah. I I was just miserable with it.
[06:22] So, like what what do you do to get that
[06:26] working? Because you were telling me
[06:27] about this yesterday.
[06:28] >> Okay. Yeah.
[06:28] >> Right.
[06:29] >> So, one of the things that I like to do
[06:31] is use a feature that's called git work
[06:33] trees. Uh, and you can do this by
[06:36] opening up the folder that contains your
[06:39] project and having it create a new git
[06:41] work tree for every piece of work that
[06:44] you're wanting to do. And for people
[06:45] that don't know, git work trees allow
[06:48] you to create a branch, check it out
[06:50] locally. And when you're working on the
[06:52] files, it will be doing it in isolation.
[06:56] So once it's done with it, it can just
[06:59] create a a merge commit back into the
[07:01] main. But you can use agent manager to
[07:03] open up each of the subfolders as
[07:05] subtasks and they can all be working
[07:07] together.
[07:08] >> So when you open up the agent manager,
[07:10] do you open up each project as a sub
[07:13] project?
[07:13] >> I've done it both ways and both work.
[07:15] Okay.
[07:16] >> So you can say like here is my
[07:19] orchestrator agent essentially. you're
[07:22] in charge of creating the git work trees
[07:24] and managing them and you know this is
[07:27] like the the high level like um you're
[07:29] in charge of merging and getting done
[07:31] with tasks and checking and then you can
[07:33] have sub agents that basically are
[07:35] opening up the specific folders and
[07:38] doing the tasks there as well.
[07:39] >> Okay, that's interesting because I I've
[07:41] never I've never used GitWord trees but
[07:43] >> totally. Yeah.
[07:44] >> Yeah.
[07:45] >> Yeah, they're super awesome. I
[07:46] definitely suggest people give them a
[07:48] try.
[07:48] >> Yeah. And then how do you think you
[07:50] could do something similar with Gemini
[07:52] CLI?
[07:53] >> Yeah, totally. I don't think this is
[07:54] like a workflow that's specific to
[07:58] Gravity in any way. Um, in fact, I was
[08:01] starting to experiment with uh using
[08:03] this in Gemini CLI. I will say the one
[08:06] thing that's really nice about
[08:08] anti-gravity is the agent manager where
[08:11] you can just clearly map them one to
[08:12] one.
[08:13] >> Okay. Yeah. cuz I I feel like in with
[08:15] the Gemini CLI, it still runs on your in
[08:18] your terminal. So maybe you just got to
[08:19] be comfortable with like a bunch of
[08:21] terminals open.
[08:21] >> Yes.
[08:22] >> Which you could totally do with like
[08:23] T-Ux or something.
[08:24] >> Yeah. Well, I So I use T-Max with Gemini
[08:26] CLI and I used uh I have one terminal
[08:29] that's Gemini CLI and then another
[08:31] that's uh Neoim. Yeah, I was about to
[08:33] ask so like um anti-gravity like how
[08:35] does it compare to something like Neoim
[08:38] which like um I feel like Gemini CLI was
[08:40] kind of striking a nerve with you
[08:42] because it was closer to the terminal
[08:43] and also you know you kind of preferred
[08:45] some of those a different type of
[08:46] editor.
[08:47] >> Yeah. So I I like Neoim a lot because I
[08:50] SSH to my workstation. Right.
[08:53] >> Totally. So, it's I'm usually traveling
[08:55] or out and about and uh I have like a
[08:58] very nice Linux workstation in my like
[09:00] home man cave office type of thing,
[09:03] right?
[09:03] >> Yeah.
[09:04] >> Uh you've seen it on the live streams.
[09:06] And um one [clears throat] thing that I
[09:08] have down there Oh, so I use like uh
[09:10] tail scale, I think.
[09:12] >> Yep.
[09:12] >> Yeah. Tail scale to connect to it. But
[09:15] it it's funny. I went to my
[09:17] mother-in-law's for Thanksgiving and I
[09:20] was like, I'm going to save power and
[09:21] shut down this machine. And then I'm
[09:23] like up at 3 a.m. Ak
[09:27] I wound up
[09:30] and then just registering my sec my uh
[09:33] >> my public key in cloud, right?
[09:35] >> Yeah.
[09:36] >> So I got that working. I was like
[09:37] programming away. But it's it's one of
[09:39] those things where I use the Gemini CLI
[09:42] in one tab
[09:44] >> in my terminal or T-Mox
[09:46] >> setup and then I use Neo of them in the
[09:47] other. And the thing I like about
[09:49] anti-gravity specifically is the sidebar
[09:53] for like agent interactions because it
[09:54] shows you the diffs, right?
[09:56] >> Whereas a lot of the time what I do
[09:58] actually I have three tabs open but the
[10:00] the first tab is uh Gemini CLI, the
[10:02] second's neoim and then the third is
[10:04] lazy git.
[10:05] >> Oh, nice.
[10:06] >> So I use lazy git to see the diffs.
[10:08] >> Nice. Yeah, I didn't try that.
[10:09] [laughter]
[10:10] >> And and then I accept the chunks. Yeah.
[10:11] Right. Because if I use lazy git or or
[10:15] if I use anti-gravity, excuse me, what I
[10:18] notice is that I can't actually accept
[10:20] any uh or I you get the chunks in the
[10:24] screen, right? You get the disc,
[10:26] >> but then as as soon as you switch to
[10:28] like a neoim Gemini CLI setup.
[10:31] >> Yep.
[10:31] >> Mhm.
[10:32] >> It's you're just like, "Hey, do this
[10:33] thing." And then Gemini CLI will be
[10:34] like, "Oh, these are all the changes I
[10:36] want to make." And
[10:36] >> they're generally too big to fit. And I
[10:39] haven't figured out how to set up
[10:40] scrolling in T-Mox because I'm not like
[10:42] a very good like environment setup. Like
[10:45] I have to use Astro Vim because I don't
[10:47] want to write my own config files.
[10:49] >> Well, I even got Gemini CLI to set up my
[10:52] Neovent config for me. Like that was
[10:54] like one of Yeah. And it worked really
[10:56] really well. I was like,
[10:57] >> what were the decisions that it made?
[10:59] >> Like I was like I in natural language
[11:01] said I want a Neoim setup that has a
[11:03] file tree already configured. I want
[11:06] line numbers and like blah blah blah.
[11:08] And like it totally downloaded the
[11:10] plugins and installed everything.
[11:11] >> Did you set the leader? Cuz isn't the
[11:13] leader normally like
[11:15] control.
[11:16] >> Yeah. I'm I'm not sure. Yeah. But I got
[11:19] it working and I was able to make a
[11:20] bunch of edits and Yeah.
[11:22] >> Yeah. I So I like Astroin because it the
[11:25] leader is space. They have docs
[11:28] >> and then uh if I move to a machine and I
[11:30] can't access my git profile or whatever,
[11:33] >> I could just go download it from there.
[11:35] Right. uh having like set up all these
[11:37] dot files. I did set up an Anible thing.
[11:40] >> Oh, I love Ansible.
[11:41] >> So, so I will I will actually uh gosh I
[11:45] think it's called SCP to the machine.
[11:47] Yeah. transfer the files over, run the
[11:49] Ansible playbook,
[11:50] >> which I have like a SH file for, and
[11:52] then I always just grab like
[11:54] >> the most basic OS that everybody has,
[11:56] Auntu or DBN or whatever,
[11:58] >> where it's not like I don't have to
[12:00] configure like a million things and then
[12:02] it just runs
[12:03] >> and I considered Nyx,
[12:06] >> but the problem with Nyx that I have
[12:10] is a lot of the times they don't have
[12:12] the packages that I want and I have to
[12:14] start building the packages.
[12:16] But I don't want to spend a lot of time
[12:18] building packages that
[12:21] >> you're not going to use. Yeah.
[12:22] >> Or that I have to maintain or and it's
[12:24] one of those things where I don't spin
[12:26] up a machine like every day. It's like
[12:28] once a month or
[12:30] >> so. Okay. Two things. One, have you
[12:32] tried SSH and anti-gravity? because I
[12:35] feel like what you're you're doing right
[12:37] now is using Neovm inside of the
[12:39] installed machine, but I've been
[12:41] starting to just like SSH into my home
[12:44] lab directly, run all the things, and I
[12:46] can have my agent with an async manager
[12:48] with all the different nodes doing
[12:50] things like running my Antible
[12:52] playbooks, running scripts on a K3S
[12:54] cluster, stuff like that.
[12:55] >> Uh, this is where you're probably going
[12:57] to think I'm like criminally insane,
[12:59] [laughter] but uh I will I I'll plug a
[13:02] keyboard into my phone.
[13:04] >> [laughter]
[13:04] >> Yes. And you did show me a demo with
[13:06] that.
[13:07] >> Yeah. Or like I'll plug it into the
[13:09] monitor and run in like desktop mode and
[13:10] I have like an app that I can use to
[13:12] SSH.
[13:12] >> Oh yes.
[13:13] >> It has like keys and all that.
[13:15] >> Totally. Yeah.
[13:16] >> And you can like Bluetooth your mouse
[13:18] into it. So like you still have a setup
[13:20] and then if I have a monitor, great. If
[13:22] I don't, I'm just like
[13:23] >> Yeah. Exactly.
[13:24] >> Granted, the screen's really tiny, so I
[13:26] don't do it all that often.
[13:27] >> Sometimes I do it on like a like an
[13:29] iPad, right?
[13:30] >> Okay. And then uh very rarely do I have
[13:34] like my personal laptop that I'm
[13:37] comfortable sshing into okay my own my
[13:40] own machine. Right. So
[13:42] >> but so with anti-gravity you can SSH to
[13:45] another machine.
[13:46] >> Yeah. In fact you uh you know when you
[13:48] talked about setting up a temporary VM
[13:50] inside of Google Cloud you can just set
[13:52] that up and as long as you set up the
[13:54] SSH keys you can from anti-gravity
[13:56] connect to it. And in fact, anti-gravity
[13:59] was built for a lot of enterprise use
[14:01] cases in mine. So you can just totally
[14:04] have that workflow
[14:05] >> bin client.
[14:06] >> Not only that, it will tunnel the ports
[14:09] from the VM into your local host.
[14:12] >> So I can be running a web server and
[14:14] using my local browser to to view it.
[14:16] And it's like the coolest thing. So you
[14:18] don't actually have to set up like so I
[14:21] believe the the SSH tunnel is usually
[14:24] like hyphen L and then you do like that
[14:26] port binding thing. You don't have to do
[14:27] any of that.
[14:28] >> No, you literally just give it the host.
[14:29] You log in as the SSH user or with your
[14:32] SSH keys and it it'll do a one-time
[14:34] setup on the uh server side.
[14:36] >> Oh, that is cool.
[14:37] >> Yes, it is super awesome.
[14:40] >> I might have to go home and try it.
[14:41] >> Yeah, it is
[14:42] >> like right now. And it it changes how I
[14:44] approach like oh I want to do this thing
[14:47] and I know how to write this in docker
[14:49] compose maybe I can have anti-gravity
[14:52] write the kubernetes file and then
[14:53] deploy it to the cluster or I want to do
[14:55] this type of maintenance and so write
[14:57] the anible playbook go and apply it and
[14:59] it's like just approaching those kind of
[15:01] like devops types of things is so much
[15:03] more
[15:04] >> you have your own kubernetes cluster too
[15:06] don't you?
[15:06] >> Yes. And that is a Pi cluster if I'm not
[15:09] mistaken.
[15:10] >> It's a five node Raspberry Pi cluster.
[15:12] Almost all of them have the 16 gig RAM
[15:14] variant. So, uh I use it for my local
[15:18] hosted GitHub action runners. I host my
[15:21] parents websites, you know. It's it's
[15:22] really
[15:23] >> on that is it rough?
[15:25] >> It's very solid. Like I
[15:27] >> I usually
[15:28] >> Are they armed?
[15:29] >> Yeah, they're all armed. Okay.
[15:30] >> Yeah.
[15:30] >> Yeah, that's interesting. Yeah.
[15:32] >> How long did it take you to set that up?
[15:33] Um, honestly having the nodes in the
[15:36] rack did not take a long time. It was
[15:39] trying to land on what I wanted to do
[15:42] for deploying stuff on it. Um,
[15:44] originally I was using Docker with just
[15:47] like Docker Compose and then I switched
[15:49] to Docker Swarm. Yeah.
[15:51] >> But one of the things that's nice about
[15:52] K3S and the reason I migrated to it is
[15:56] um when you have things like a NAS or
[15:58] like uh a Synology or things like that,
[16:01] you can do persistent volume claims
[16:04] >> where it will manage the connecting to
[16:07] the storage and doing it for the
[16:09] cluster. Whereas in Docker Compose and
[16:12] Docker, it really is meant to be run on
[16:15] like a mini PC. They're not meant to be
[16:18] running clusters. like it can work but
[16:20] storage is kind of like an afterthought
[16:22] in networking like I had to like do this
[16:24] weird ingress with
[16:26] >> uh inject proxy manager and stuff like
[16:28] that. So
[16:28] >> see I I think I'm the opposite of you
[16:31] >> where I just use Cloud Run.
[16:34] >> Cloud Run's amazing.
[16:35] >> It's cheap enough.
[16:37] >> Yes. Yeah.
[16:38] >> Right. And it like there's I very rarely
[16:42] do I ever get a bill from Cloud Run and
[16:44] I've run some like
[16:45] >> Agreed. I've run like big style transfer
[16:47] models and all this other stuff on
[16:49] there.
[16:49] >> A pie cluster. Maybe we should set one
[16:51] up one weekend. Just come down.
[16:53] >> Absolutely.
[16:53] >> We'll just buy some used Raspberry Pies
[16:55] cuz they're like what? $30 new. That's
[16:57] yours for my blood.
[16:59] >> Uh
[16:59] >> except for the RAM prices now. They're
[17:01] all going up. But
[17:02] >> Oh, are they?
[17:02] >> Yeah.
[17:03] >> Oh, no.
[17:04] >> Yeah. I I think um being able to um
[17:07] approach a PI cluster has made me build
[17:10] with Cloud Run in a completely different
[17:12] way. Like I have many cloudr run
[17:14] instances, but sometimes it's hard to
[17:16] like prototype what you're wanting to
[17:19] build outside of running it. And so I
[17:21] can run something that I know is only
[17:23] going to last for a month a lot easier
[17:25] in the cluster. Whereas when I'm going
[17:27] to do something for production, um like
[17:30] cloud run even supports like dock
[17:31] compose files now. So like I can have a
[17:34] multi-node thing all working together
[17:35] and I don't even have to change
[17:36] anything. I can just deploy and it's
[17:39] super awesome. The reason why I want a
[17:40] Kubernetes cluster is solely so that way
[17:43] I can run like Reddus.
[17:45] >> Oh yes.
[17:46] >> Right. Like one of those things that
[17:47] don't work well in like the ephemeral
[17:49] cloud run like this is your machine.
[17:51] Goodbye.
[17:52] >> Yeah, that's fair.
[17:52] >> Right. And uh I thought about like
[17:56] trying to
[17:58] >> hack together this weird like Reddis
[18:00] server setup.
[18:01] >> Yeah.
[18:02] >> But then it seems like what am I doing
[18:04] with my life if I'm sitting there like
[18:06] okay I'll get like a mint micro instance
[18:07] and I'll do this.
[18:08] >> Yes. and set all this up. But yeah,
[18:11] >> I also think if you can prove and
[18:13] validate the idea in a local
[18:16] environment, then it'll shine really
[18:19] well in a cloudr run environment.
[18:22] >> Okay.
[18:22] >> So like uh you've already like made a
[18:26] really good choice about what language
[18:27] you're using, the type of uh scaling
[18:30] around how you're compiling. Yeah. And I
[18:32] feel like when you're deploying a cloud
[18:34] run, you're you're committed to the
[18:36] idea, but it's like, you know, you want
[18:38] to have um some type of trajectory going
[18:41] into production where, you know, yes,
[18:44] there's many things that we deploy to
[18:46] Cloud Run that, you know, almost never
[18:48] get used, right? But if you're like, how
[18:51] do I actually build an app that runs on
[18:53] Cloud Run and actually can handle
[18:55] traffic and do all these different
[18:56] things, you have to like really start to
[18:59] play with how am I what am I going to do
[19:00] about storage and caching like you said,
[19:02] Reddus and and all these other things
[19:04] all working together. Um, and so that's
[19:06] where like having a hybrid approach can
[19:08] be really good.
[19:09] >> Yeah. plus just like you know Google
[19:12] does a lot with Kubernetes and so I feel
[19:15] like I just been wanting to learn that
[19:16] forever and so it's just been I've been
[19:19] chipping away at the different layers of
[19:21] it and I feel like it's starting to
[19:23] click a little bit and uh hopefully
[19:24] future episodes we can know more too but
[19:27] uh like once you get into that world
[19:30] you're able to like start to think
[19:31] declaratively instead of imperatively
[19:33] >> so so does Kubernet do you use
[19:36] anti-gravity to set up your Kubernetes
[19:38] deployments and all Yes, because I I
[19:41] understand docker compose really well.
[19:43] >> Okay.
[19:44] >> And I can say this is how I would deploy
[19:46] this with docker compose.
[19:48] >> Yeah.
[19:49] >> Write the kubernetes file
[19:51] >> for me from this docker compose file.
[19:53] >> And so from there
[19:55] >> it allows me to
[19:58] bridge what I am doing to where I want
[20:00] to be. And that's where I think AI is a
[20:03] great companion in that transformation
[20:05] of content and bridging that gap.
[20:07] >> Okay. So eventually I'll be able to
[20:09] write Kubernetes files
[20:11] >> directly. Yes.
[20:12] >> Yeah. So you're you're using it as
[20:15] >> I have this Docker Compose setup. I want
[20:17] to migrate it to Kubernetes.
[20:19] >> Yes.
[20:20] >> Here's like what my Do you tell it like
[20:21] your cluster information or anything or
[20:22] you just let
[20:23] >> Exactly. Or at least give it like a tool
[20:25] to find out the node status and other
[20:27] things like that.
[20:28] >> Oh, okay.
[20:28] >> So yeah. So, are you building your own
[20:30] tools that then you consume an
[20:32] anti-gravity through MCP or some other
[20:34] >> It's more like I give it a AI rules on
[20:37] like um here's my home lab setup with
[20:39] the things I installed and configured
[20:41] like you can run these commands on these
[20:43] servers to get health statuses and
[20:45] things like that and it can go and it it
[20:47] will totally SSH into the the the nodes
[20:51] run docker logs and it'll get out the
[20:53] status and it'll be uh giving you like a
[20:56] really cool way to work with the
[20:58] cluster. Like I can I can say things
[21:00] like um this service is down. Can you
[21:03] figure out why? And it'll be it'll go
[21:06] and say, "Oh, it's in an unhealthy
[21:07] state. Let me go try this thing. Oh,
[21:10] it's not connecting to this, you know,
[21:12] service and stuff like that." Yeah.
[21:13] >> Does anti-gravity automatically find
[21:17] your AI rules file or does it look for
[21:19] like a Gemini MD file?
[21:21] >> Because Gemini CLI, I believe,
[21:23] >> yeah,
[21:24] >> has a preference towards Gemini.md
[21:26] files. Yes, I believe uh by default
[21:28] anti-gravity uses Gemini MD at the root
[21:31] of your project.
[21:32] >> Okay.
[21:32] >> Um but it's super easy to just tag it as
[21:35] context inside of um anti-gravity chat.
[21:39] Yeah.
[21:39] >> You can just like at whatever the name
[21:41] is and
[21:42] >> you can usually when I start a task I I
[21:46] will tag the readmes that I want it to
[21:48] do. Oh, if you have multiple rules files
[21:52] >> and then you just say like, hey, use AI
[21:54] rules
[21:55] >> for Kubernetes.
[21:57] Y
[21:58] >> okay, gotcha. Y
[21:59] >> and then how complicated are those rules
[22:01] files? Do you write them yourself?
[22:03] >> So I usually what I like to do with AI
[22:06] too is I'll write the worst version and
[22:09] have AI write the better version. So,
[22:12] uh, I think I think we've talked about
[22:14] this before outside of the podcast, but,
[22:16] um, I feel like now I will write an
[22:20] extremely ugly class. I'll get
[22:23] everything working. I'll write all the
[22:24] methods. I will write all of the the
[22:27] features. I know it technically works.
[22:30] >> Yeah.
[22:30] >> But then what I do is I have it create
[22:33] the formatted class with the nicely
[22:35] documented. And uh by doing an approach
[22:38] like that, I can write my intent in this
[22:42] like short paragraph of like it needs to
[22:44] talk about this blah blah blah blah blah
[22:46] and uh it will use search grounding. It
[22:49] will use research to be able to expand
[22:51] that and then I save that as context in
[22:53] the file.
[22:53] >> So let me blow your mind.
[22:56] >> Let's hear it.
[22:57] >> There's this tool that I use to write my
[22:58] gemini.md files.
[23:00] >> Let's hear it.
[23:01] >> It's called notebook ln.
[23:03] >> Yeah,
[23:03] >> that's a good one. It's so good at
[23:06] writing the rules files cuz
[23:07] >> So tell me about that workflow. Yeah.
[23:09] >> Yeah. So what I do is I literally just
[23:11] import every piece of documentation I
[23:14] can find on the internet into a a a
[23:17] notebook, right?
[23:18] >> Okay.
[23:19] >> Individual notebooks or do you like to
[23:21] like scope it like just this is my AR
[23:24] rules?
[23:25] >> No, I I I have individual notebooks. So
[23:27] I had one for like firebased security
[23:29] rules. I had one for uh AI logic. I had
[23:32] one for like a bunch of different things
[23:34] that I was like, "Ah, let me just see
[23:36] like with no context, can it get me to
[23:38] the next level, right?"
[23:40] >> Okay.
[23:40] >> So, I imported
[23:43] like every piece of documentation I
[23:44] could find. I went to the reference
[23:45] docs. I imported that and then I went to
[23:48] notebook LM and you can get custom
[23:50] reports.
[23:51] >> Oh,
[23:51] >> I said write a agents.md file for me
[23:55] that goes indepth about how and when to
[23:58] implement this set of knowledge. Right.
[24:00] >> Oh, cool. And when I tested out the one
[24:03] for Firebase security rules, but it gave
[24:05] me a very long report and I skimmed it.
[24:08] I was like, "This seems good enough,
[24:09] right?"
[24:09] >> Okay.
[24:10] >> And then I asked it to implement
[24:13] security rules in a project that didn't
[24:15] have them.
[24:16] >> It went through it and it was actually a
[24:19] sample project that I used, right? So
[24:21] the sample projects have like pretty
[24:23] good security rules. They say check for
[24:25] this, check for this, check for this. It
[24:27] wrote a set of security rules that had
[24:29] validation in it. Oh wow. Which is
[24:32] something I don't normally do when I
[24:33] write security rules. I'm like, "Yeah,
[24:34] if like
[24:36] >> uh they can only insert like these
[24:38] fields and this, right?" But it was like
[24:39] it can only insert a integer in the star
[24:42] field between one and five.
[24:43] >> Oh, yeah. Like literally almost like arc
[24:45] type or like um some type of structured
[24:48] validation. So, and I think that's like
[24:50] one of the things that is sometimes
[24:51] overlooked with security rules is that
[24:54] people will write a set of security
[24:56] rules,
[24:58] but if you know the schema and you know
[25:00] how to write to it, you could
[25:01] hypothetically
[25:03] >> inject any data you want.
[25:04] >> As long as it fits the type. Yeah. Yeah.
[25:06] >> But as long as you have that that
[25:08] validation Yeah.
[25:09] >> of like it has to be a string, it has to
[25:10] be a number, it can only be this long,
[25:12] blah blah blah blah blah blah blah,
[25:14] >> it will get to the point where it it
[25:16] really tightens it down. And then on top
[25:18] of that, you know what it did?
[25:20] >> It added tests.
[25:22] >> Yeah.
[25:22] >> And then it rules
[25:23] >> to the rules. And then it loaded the
[25:25] emulator.
[25:26] >> Wow.
[25:26] >> To then run the test for me,
[25:28] >> which probably you knew how to do in
[25:30] isolation, but never like an entire file
[25:33] on how to like describe this.
[25:34] >> When I was building the notebook LM
[25:37] >> Yeah.
[25:37] >> bits, I went and I was just grabbing
[25:40] everything everything that I could find.
[25:42] And one of the things I found was this
[25:43] like security rules testing framework,
[25:46] right?
[25:47] >> Yeah. I was like, I've never seen this.
[25:49] That's awesome.
[25:50] >> And I it's like I feel like I should
[25:52] know about it.
[25:52] >> Yeah.
[25:52] >> So, when I discovered it, I was like,
[25:54] this is incredible. Why don't we talk
[25:55] about this more? And uh and then I just
[25:59] loaded it into my agent
[26:00] >> and it compiled and built and nearly
[26:03] worked first try.
[26:04] >> So, when you're using Notebook LM to
[26:06] kind of find these resources, are you
[26:09] >> um trying to
[26:11] >> go out and paste a bunch of links in?
[26:13] Are you uploading files that you have
[26:15] directly for the context? like what are
[26:17] you doing there?
[26:17] >> I very rarely have a file on my laptop.
[26:20] It's mostly like, you know, photos I've
[26:22] taken or things like that.
[26:23] >> Uh I try and keep all my files online.
[26:26] So I will go
[26:28] >> and I will grab links from different
[26:31] websites, okay, via Google search
[26:33] >> and insert them into the notebook or
[26:35] I'll crawl manually. There's probably an
[26:38] automated way to do this, fair,
[26:39] >> but I will crawl a page and grab the
[26:41] resource links that I want,
[26:43] >> which I have done that. Yeah, what I
[26:45] usually do is just write a script in
[26:46] Chrome DevTools and copy out all the A
[26:48] tags.
[26:50] >> Rudy, what do [clears throat] you do?
[26:51] [laughter]
[26:55] >> How do How do you just make your life so
[26:56] easy like that? [laughter]
[26:59] >> I'm like, well, I'm not going to
[27:00] manually copy all these, so I so I just
[27:02] Yeah. Right.
[27:03] >> Well, the thing is I always like want to
[27:04] look at the page and be like, is this
[27:05] relevant? And then like pull it in. I
[27:07] see what you're saying. Like, oh, it's
[27:09] much easier to just write like a script
[27:10] tag, pull out the thing, drop the like
[27:13] do what is it? beautiful soup to like
[27:14] clean it out.
[27:15] >> Yeah. Or like uh so there's two ways
[27:18] that I found that to be really useful.
[27:20] One is uh if I go to Firebase or Flutter
[27:23] or some type of doc site, they're going
[27:25] to have a sidenav with a bunch of links
[27:27] to every link on that site. I believe we
[27:30] support [snorts] um LM's text now. Yeah.
[27:33] >> And so we should have make that a lot
[27:35] easier. But before I could just write a
[27:37] simple script that went to the nav,
[27:39] grabbed all the address and then from
[27:41] there I could literally paste it as a
[27:43] block in.
[27:43] >> That sounds so much smarter than what I
[27:45] was doing.
[27:46] >> And like sometimes like I don't know
[27:48] what it is, but like the internet
[27:50] provider will just be like, "You seem to
[27:51] be navigating a lot. How about just slow
[27:53] down and read the content for once,
[27:54] bud?"
[27:55] >> Yeah.
[27:55] >> You know, and then like
[27:57] >> maybe it's just my my internet service
[27:59] provider. Who knows? But I I Yeah, I I
[28:02] go to each page, look it over.
[28:05] >> Nice.
[28:06] >> I do it the wrong way.
[28:07] >> Yeah, [laughter]
[28:08] >> you're the human in the loop on the
[28:10] finding the context.
[28:11] >> Oh, I'm always a human in the loop.
[28:12] >> That's awesome. Well, that's that's a
[28:14] really cool use case with using it for
[28:16] writing the agent uh MD files. I have
[28:19] not been doing that and I might actually
[28:21] add that to my workflow.
[28:22] >> Yeah, it's well worth it.
[28:24] >> Yeah, totally. And plus it keeps the
[28:26] content up to date and a bunch of other
[28:28] reasons why that's important. Do you
[28:30] leave the like a bunch of different
[28:32] agent MD files in in your projects when
[28:35] you work with anti-gravity?
[28:36] >> I do you selectively add and pull them
[28:39] in?
[28:39] >> Yeah, I feel like I selectively bring
[28:41] them down. I try to think about context
[28:44] as a an artifact, but that it's not, you
[28:47] know, persistent, you know, like you can
[28:49] have this for the moment in time that
[28:50] you're needing it. So I I usually create
[28:52] like a research folder or a docs folder
[28:54] and I add in markdown files that are
[28:56] specific to
[28:58] >> you know deep researches that I've run
[29:00] or um like like I could have one on
[29:03] here's how to deploy with cloud run on
[29:06] all the configs on like a specific
[29:08] advanced kind of like storage and
[29:10] whatever and then I have a different one
[29:12] that's here's how to work with SQLite
[29:14] and set it up for the environment and
[29:16] that kind of allows me to tag the agent
[29:18] on those files when I'm like okay we're
[29:20] working on the database base adapter
[29:21] like here go look at this thing and this
[29:23] is like the setup I want and then also
[29:25] here's a deep research on the schema
[29:26] that I'm planning on.
[29:27] >> My my issue with like
[29:31] >> gemini.md files in the Google CLI Gemini
[29:34] CLI
[29:34] >> is that you you can nest them in
[29:37] different folders
[29:38] >> but then I feel like the context just
[29:40] gets clobbered over time. It just gets
[29:42] overwhelmed.
[29:43] >> Oh, 100%. That's why you have to be so
[29:45] specific on um either if you can try to
[29:50] paste it as content directly even if
[29:51] it's a subp part so I can like select it
[29:54] all and just paste it as markdown and
[29:55] the model will be able to read it.
[29:57] >> Yeah.
[29:57] >> Um but otherwise yeah having multiple
[29:59] broken up files makes that a lot better
[30:02] cuz inside Gemini CLI for instance you
[30:05] can at other files with the at syntax
[30:09] and if you open up a file it'll
[30:10] basically just concatenate them
[30:11] together. So you can basically tag the
[30:14] lowest possible file that contains the
[30:17] context you need or you know contain
[30:20] >> you do an at file and then put in line
[30:22] numbers like does that work where it
[30:24] only extracts those line numbers or does
[30:25] it
[30:25] >> not that I found it might be supported
[30:27] but
[30:28] >> that would be cool.
[30:29] >> I do know in anti-gravity you can select
[30:32] a range of part of a file and it will
[30:34] show as the context.
[30:35] >> I've seen that.
[30:36] >> Yeah, which is super cool. Yeah.
[30:37] >> Yeah. because then you're not like just
[30:39] sending over this huge file. And
[30:41] sometimes sometimes I like Gemini CLI
[30:43] will do smart things for me,
[30:45] >> right? So like one time I asked it like
[30:46] in this very large file like, "Hey, can
[30:48] you like do this thing?"
[30:49] >> And it found another method that already
[30:51] exists that did the thing I was looking
[30:52] for.
[30:53] >> Nice.
[30:54] >> It's what happens when you work in
[30:55] unfamiliar code bases, right? Or like
[30:57] you write code for like long enough and
[30:58] you're like, "Oh, I needed to like do
[31:00] this. Can you like help me just like
[31:01] stub out this method real quick?" And
[31:03] it's like, "Yeah, sure." And then it'll
[31:04] like you write the stub and then it
[31:06] injects like the other method name like
[31:08] right in there and like
[31:11] >> I should take a nap,
[31:12] >> right? Yeah.
[31:13] >> Yeah.
[31:14] >> One thing that we talked about this
[31:16] morning in the live stream.
[31:18] >> Yeah.
[31:18] >> That I know that you've been doing a lot
[31:20] of
[31:20] >> Yeah.
[31:20] >> is you've been pairing Stitch and
[31:23] anti-gravity.
[31:23] >> Oh, yeah. Totally.
[31:24] >> Yeah. Do you want to tell me how that's
[31:28] been working for you and like what
[31:29] you've been doing with that?
[31:30] >> Totally. Um, one of the cool things
[31:31] about Stitch is it will generate both
[31:34] web apps and mobile apps
[31:37] >> and you know, you can make them
[31:38] responsive and get all the different um,
[31:41] HTML and images for it. But one of the
[31:44] nice things Stitch does is with Gemini
[31:47] 3, in addition to creating way better
[31:49] designs and I feel like uh, a lot closer
[31:52] to what I'm wanting, it can also even
[31:54] redesign existing apps. So using Nano
[31:57] Banana Pro, you can say, "Here's my
[31:59] really terrible UI that I don't know how
[32:01] to write. Can you make it look better?"
[32:03] And uh one of the cool things about that
[32:06] flow is you take that, copy it into
[32:08] Gemini, and say, "Okay, for this image
[32:10] and possibly the HTML,
[32:12] >> generate me a Flutter app, generate me
[32:14] React or Angular, whatever." It can like
[32:18] really effectively generate uh some
[32:21] really cool things. So, one of the apps
[32:23] that I've been working on is a
[32:26] generative UI type of demo that includes
[32:29] some really cool features with ADK,
[32:32] which we talked about last week, and and
[32:34] some other exciting things with Gemini,
[32:36] but it's a very visually impressive
[32:40] demo, which requires a lot of gradients,
[32:43] a lot of design choices around uh
[32:46] animations and stuff like that. All of
[32:48] which usually take the majority of my
[32:50] time.
[32:51] >> Yeah. Yeah.
[32:51] >> And so what I've been doing is having
[32:52] Gemini take those screenshots and it's
[32:55] been writing the gradients and the
[32:57] shaders in every part of the application
[33:00] including the animations like so
[33:02] effectively.
[33:03] >> Now when it writes the gradients does it
[33:04] write it as CSS or does it write it as
[33:07] here's an image that has a gradient set
[33:09] it as your background that I generated
[33:10] with Nano Banana.
[33:11] >> What's even crazier is it's actually
[33:13] taking the screenshot that's inside the
[33:15] Gemini app and creating
[33:18] >> the gradients in Flutter. like it will
[33:20] write the flutter linear gradient
[33:22] >> from the colors in the image. Oh,
[33:25] >> and yeah, and it can use Nana Banana to
[33:28] generate some uh image assets and I have
[33:30] done that, but I was like,
[33:32] >> wait, what if we just made this a shader
[33:35] like instead of a gradient, let's make
[33:37] this an animated mesh background and
[33:39] like anti-gravity is able to to take
[33:41] that context, write the shader code, set
[33:45] up the animation controllers, and
[33:48] >> you're able to all of a sudden unlock a
[33:49] workflow where whereas before, you know,
[33:52] I'm not the strongest at writing
[33:54] shaders. I I could get a basic version
[33:57] working, but now I could even just like
[33:59] prototype like,
[34:00] >> does it even work? Like, will this look
[34:02] good? And then, you know, it it was done
[34:05] in faster than it usually takes for me
[34:07] to even get started on getting the first
[34:09] version running. So, uh, I I feel like
[34:11] that workflow has just been so awesome
[34:13] to experiment with design choices that
[34:15] usually I'm afraid of implementing
[34:18] because I know how much it's going to
[34:19] cost to keep those up to date or like
[34:22] reason about the code. Usually have kind
[34:24] of geared towards
[34:26] >> simpler UIs or at least UIs that are
[34:29] more focused on UX. But now it's like,
[34:31] >> cool. Yeah, I'll do a really crazy
[34:34] design that involves multiple section
[34:36] headers and and different types of text
[34:38] elements and animations cuz I can just
[34:41] reiterate on it really quickly.
[34:43] >> Yeah. So, you're able to iterate over a
[34:46] bunch of different shaders.
[34:47] >> Yes.
[34:47] >> Right. And and you you're saying you
[34:49] don't have to write a single line of
[34:51] code there? N
[34:52] >> it just does it, injects it, you're good
[34:54] to go.
[34:55] >> Yep. and it will not only write and
[34:57] update the shader code, it will also
[35:00] write the logic that calls the shader,
[35:03] animates the uniforms, and connects it
[35:05] to the UI as well. So, it's just been
[35:08] super awesome. In this app that I'm
[35:09] working on, I'm up to three shaders in
[35:11] the app already. And I feel like that's
[35:13] already three more than I've added in
[35:14] previous apps. So, uh I've been super
[35:17] happy about it.
[35:17] >> Yeah, that sounds incredible.
[35:20] >> All right, no. So, is there anything
[35:21] else that you want to kind of share that
[35:23] you've been working on or excited about
[35:24] that you want to kind of close us out
[35:26] with?
[35:26] >> Uh, there is something I've been working
[35:29] on. It's uh surrounding prompting.
[35:32] >> Okay, cool.
[35:32] >> And prompt optimization, but I think I
[35:35] want to pull the covers back on that
[35:36] next week.
[35:37] >> Sounds good. All right, cool. You have
[35:38] to stay tuned for that. Um, I feel like
[35:40] there has been so much to explore just
[35:43] in the last few weeks. Um, there
[35:46] anti-gravity and Gemini CLI and Stitch
[35:49] and so many other things we talked about
[35:50] are just like some amazing tools that I
[35:54] feel like just unlock these workflows
[35:56] that I I have been just waiting for. You
[35:58] know, I have been trying to to do a lot
[36:00] of these things and you get really far
[36:03] but then sometimes you just like hit the
[36:05] ceiling that you're just like I can't I
[36:07] can't break through like this. I'm
[36:09] running into too much context or you
[36:11] know it's just a little bit too soon.
[36:14] But now I feel like a lot of those
[36:16] projects are I can pick up and like um
[36:18] I'm able to get those done in like an
[36:20] afternoon whereas before it was like a
[36:22] week or so.
[36:23] >> I mean even just going back and reviving
[36:24] old projects, right?
[36:26] >> Totally. Yeah. Yeah.
[36:27] >> Yeah. Things have been dead for months,
[36:28] you just hand it off to Jules and you're
[36:29] like, "Hey."
[36:30] >> Yep.
[36:30] >> Make sure I can run this in today, you
[36:32] know?
[36:32] >> Totally. And which I would suggest as a
[36:34] fun exercise for people, uh, go to your
[36:37] your old apps on GitHub, upload
[36:40] screenshots of them running into Stitch,
[36:43] have it generate a nice fresh new UI,
[36:46] open that up in anti-gravity, and just
[36:48] give it a nice
[36:49] >> redesign. Yeah. And you'll be surprised
[36:51] at how well that works.
[36:52] >> Cool.
[36:53] >> Awesome.
[36:54] >> Well, thanks for uh listening to us
[36:56] yabber on.
[36:57] >> Sounds good. All right, see you next
[36:59] time.
[36:59] >> Ciao.
